Contributing to Hydrostats
==========================

Steps
^^^^^
The steps to contributing are simple:

1. Download git
2. Clone the Hydrostats repository
3. Develop features that you would like implemented, including a docstring in functions of classes in the
   numpydoc format.
4. Add a test case to cover the code that you created (hydrostats/tests directory, in tests.py)
5. Create a new pull request with your changes

A note to members of the BYU-Hydroinformatics group. Please make pull requests before merging changes to the master
branch, as this allows continuous integration testing to take place.
